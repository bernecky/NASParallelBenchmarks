 *   This file is to give an overview of the SAC demo programs of this
 *   directory.
 *
 *   The directory comes with a Makefile that contains pattern rules
 *   for making executables from SAC-source files. Therefore each of the
 *   demo programs <name>.sac can be compiled by simply running (GNU-)
 *   "make <name>". The pattern rules provided even comprise an implicit
 *   dependency-checking system. It makes sure that any module needed for
 *   the compilation of a particular program will be compiled on beforehand.
